##Briefly About Myself:
######In 2021 I received my BA in Psychology and Social Work. 
######For 4 years of study I have achieved great success: I was nominated for the title "The best graduate of BSU", received a diploma with honors and more.
######Since 2015, programming has been just a hobby. But now I have serious intentions to change the field of activity.

######For July 2021 I:
1. completed 1 freelance order. I created a [landing page](https://skvazzhin.by/), placed it on the server and set up mail .
2. created a web application for librarians. Within the framework of the project, I learned to work with Orakle, Java, Spring, Js (*sorry, but I don't have a link to this project yet. It's coming soon*).
